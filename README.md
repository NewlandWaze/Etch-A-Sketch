# Etch and Sketch with Interactive Square

This Etch and Sketch project introduces a series of modifications to the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse. Instead of a simple color change, each interaction randomizes the square's RGB value entirely. Additionally, a progressive darkening effect is implemented where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square after ten interactions.

## Features

- **Interactive Square**: Interact with the square using your mouse to observe the modifications.
- **Randomized RGB**: Each interaction randomizes the square's RGB value, creating a unique color combination.
- **Progressive Darkening**: The square progressively darkens by adding 10% more black or color with each interaction.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Open the Etch and Sketch application in your web browser.
2. Move your mouse over the square to start the interaction.
3. Each interaction will completely randomize the RGB value of the square, resulting in a unique color.
4. As you continue interacting with the square, it will progressively darken.
5. After ten interactions, the square will achieve a completely black color.
